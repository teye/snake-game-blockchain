# Snake Game Blockchain

This is a poc snake game that features NFT and leaderboard stored on Sepolia Testnet.

### Instructions

The game requires you to own a Snake NFT. Instructions are found within the game UI.

You would also need Sepolia ETH.

### Project Info

NFT metadata are uploaded on [IPFS](https://lavender-eligible-mosquito-391.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmWQfrtKz3koNRkV1EJgM7VJ2kzJ3yummMBUNRXDKRt8dp/)

NFT Contract: [0xB3a54BeBd28838c303c44f8fD7E1E5c7560a11F5](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xB3a54BeBd28838c303c44f8fD7E1E5c7560a11F5)

Leaderboard Contract: [0x33367d50f7dc1C4b922790341Bc009371f179b44](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x33367d50f7dc1C4b922790341Bc009371f179b44)

### Import NFT to Metamask

You may import the NFT into your Metamask wallet.

On Metamask, enable `Opensea API`. `Settings > Security & Privacy > Enable OpenSea API`.

Go to your wallet, `NFTs` tab, scroll down and `Import NFT`, type in the NFT Contract address and your token ID. You may retrieve them these two information in the game.

### Development

1. Deploy NFT contract
2. Deploy Leaderboard contract

3. Create a `.env` with these variables:

```
REACT_APP_LEADERBOARD_PK=<private_key used to deploy leaderboard contract in Step 2>
```

This private key is required for the frontend to update the score on behalf of the user.

4. Run `npm start`
